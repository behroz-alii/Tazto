# Tazto – Food Ordering Mobile App (Flutter)

## 👋 About the Project

**Tazto** is a complete mobile application built using **Flutter**, not just focused on UI but also on real app functionality.

Along with designing a clean and modern interface, I connected the app to **Firebase**, implemented **Firebase Authentication**, and integrated **Stripe** for online payments. The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world food ordering experience — from browsing items to secure checkout.

This project reflects how I approach mobile apps end-to-end: **design, logic, backend integration, and payments**.
